<h2>Proposal</h2>

<h3>Domain Background</h3>

<p>As people age, they inevitably retire from their jobs to live off their savings. If you google for &ldquo;retirement investing today&rdquo;,
you will find around 143 million related web pages on the WWW. So the topic is very relevant to many people. In Germany,
a regular employee has to
spend a certain percentage of his salary on a state-run insurance, but they can also opt to save more an put the money
into financial products to secure their financial needs during retirement. One possible way to invest money for retirement
is to participate in the stock market. This option has become more important over the last 10 years, as the fixed-interest
investment opportunities have largely vanished or yield unsatisfactory profits.</p>

<p>If a person then chooses to use the stock market for long-term retirement investment, they need to have a sound and secure
investment strategy, i.e. how much to invest, when to buy, what to buy (or sell). Ideally, the strategy leads to a long and steady
increase of the value of the portfolio, so that the money is available when they retire.
Now the problem arises , how the individual can come up with such a strategy.</p>

<p>How to do retirement investing has been a serious research topic over the last decades (e.g. <a href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0304405X06001127">Farhi and Panageas: Saving and investing for early retirement: A theoretical analysis</a>
, <a href="https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/10920277.2000.10595899">Gerber and Shiu: Investing for Retirement</a>, <a href="https://web.b.ebscohost.com/abstract?direct=true&amp;profile=ehost&amp;scope=site&amp;authtype=crawler&amp;jrnl=10403981&amp;AN=5558183&amp;h=eT7kaJlvwTYF03fBKPVPAjxrYbbIg71Il8Becp1HEiwL8qqWbRJWMYAXYjBqROYHIY%2fvI3OxVdeCqEclAZfgpQ%3d%3d&amp;crl=c&amp;resultNs=AdminWebAuth&amp;resultLocal=ErrCrlNotAuth&amp;crlhashurl=login.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26profile%3dehost%26scope%3dsite%26authtype%3dcrawler%26jrnl%3d10403981%26AN%3d5558183">Bierwirth: INVESTING FOR RETIREMENT: USING THE PAST TO MODEL THE FUTURE</a>).
I also have a personal motivation to investigate this problem, as I am an
active investor at German, European and US stock exchanges (mainly ETFs). If this project is successful, it will be very
helpful for my investment decisions.</p>

<h3>Problem Statement</h3>

<p>This capstone project aims to solve the problem of finding a good long-term investment strategy under budget, time and
risk constraints on ETFs suitable for retirement investing. Currently, investors that follow a passive approach usually have
simple strategies which might leave money on the table, and investors that follow an active approach need a lot of time
to inform themselves and make trading decisions. An investor usually faces a budget and time constraint, as they invest only a
limited amount of money per time period (e.g. per month) and they would like to minimize the overall transaction fees;
also, the investor face a risk constraint, as they cannot afford to lose their retirement savings.</p>

<p>The assessment of the algorithm to find such a strategy (i.e. the learning part of an agent) is straightforward, as you
can reuse the existing financial KPIs like returns, profitability, volatility etc. Both the inputs (trading actions) and
the outputs (financial outcomes) are quantifiable, measurable and replicable (for historic stock data).</p>

<p>The problem itself has already been researched scientifically (e.g. <a href="https://github.com/jjakimoto/DQN">Reinforcement Learning for Finance</a> and
<a href="https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3420952">Snow - Machine Learning in Asset Management</a>).</p>

<h3>Datasets and Inputs</h3>

<p>Any trading strategy has to be backtested using historic stock data; this project is using the historic stock data of
the following three indices with daily data granularity:</p>

<ul>
<li>S&amp;P 500 index:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/%5EGSPC/history?p=%5EGSPC</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ariva.de/ishares_s-p_500_ucits_etf-fonds/historische_kurse">https://www.ariva.de/ishares_s-p_500_ucits_etf-fonds/historische_kurse</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>MSCI World Index:

<ul>
<li><a href="https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/X010.DE/history?p=X010.DE">https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/X010.DE/history?p=X010.DE</a>,</li>
<li><a href="https://www.ariva.de/comstage_msci_world_trn_ucits_etf-fonds">https://www.ariva.de/comstage_msci_world_trn_ucits_etf-fonds</a></li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>STOXX EUROPE 600 ETF: <a href="https://www.ariva.de/db_x-tr-stoxx_europe_600_etf_inhaber-anteile_1c-fonds/historische_kurse">https://www.ariva.de/db_x-tr-stoxx_europe_600_etf_inhaber-anteile_1c-fonds/historische_kurse</a></li>
</ul>


<p>The three index funds are ideal financial products for retirement investing, as they offer very high diversification,
and thus very low risk of wild swings or long-term losses. The three ETFs are also globally diversified: one from the US,
 one from Europe and one covering global enterprises.
The Websites provide the data in a CSV format, with the columns: date, open price, high price, low price, close price.
Ideally, the historic data would span 10 years of stock data, with the last 2 years as test data.</p>

<p>Other inputs consist of the following financial parameters:</p>

<ul>
<li>available monthly savings of investor</li>
<li>available initial budget (no credit will be considered)</li>
<li>transaction fees based on DAB Bank for direct orders (no savings plan). This is likely to be a transaction cost rate
based on the trade volume (see also <a href="https://github.com/teddykoker/blog.git">Teddy Koker&rsquo;s Blog</a>).</li>
</ul>


<h3>Solution Statement</h3>

<p>As a solution, I would like to suggest a reinforcement-learning based agent, that learn a good trading strategy.
The agent would decide when to trade and how much to buy from the three given ETFs.
It is also supposed to stay within the given budget constraints. The agent
learns a trading strategy based on historical stock data and then runs daily and outputs the amounts to buy
or sell from the funds in the portofolio.
The goal is not to generate sustainable or supreme<br/>
&alpha; (<a href="https://www.investopedia.com/articles/investing/092115/alpha-and-beta-beginners.asp">Definition</a>), but to
automate the investment decision, free the investor of manual labour and take advantage of mid-term market developments.
The project does not focus on long-term stock forecasting using statistical methods (e.g. like in
<a href="https://github.com/Hvass-Labs/FinanceOps">Theory of Long-Term Stock Forecasting</a>), but on reinforcement learning-based solutions.</p>

<h3>Benchmark Model</h3>

<p>The benchmark for my proposed RL trading algorithm would be a passive dollar-cost averaging strategy
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dollar_cost_averaging">Link</a>) in combination with a buy-and-hold strategy
(<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Buy_and_hold">Link</a>). In essence, the investor buys each month investment products for a
constant amount of money and then holds these products indefinitely. Such a strategy would typically be
found with long-term investors building a retirement portfolio.</p>

<p>This strategy minimizes risk, but it may also overlook opportunities and does not take advantage of the market direction.
The benchmark strategy is implemented in the same programming framework as the RL agent and it is compared on the same
data from the same financial products over the same time period.</p>

<h3>Evaluation Metrics</h3>

<p>The evaluation happens on a subset of the available historic data, the test set. The two investment strategies are
evaluated using the stock data in this test set. The
metric to compare both strategies will be the total value increase after the test period, i.e. how much has the total value
of the portfolio increased using either one of the trading strategies. You can then calculate the percentage increase based
on the initial budget. A similar approach is followed in <a href="https://github.com/huseinzol05/Stock-Prediction-Models">Stock prediction models</a>.
The total value is the Euro value of the portfolio at the last day of the test period plus the remaining budget.</p>

<p><a href="https://github.com/teddykoker/blog.git">Teddy Koker&rsquo;s Blog entry</a> uses the Sharpe ratio as a metric for the risk-adjusted  performance of an investment
over time. This metric might be an alternative to the purely monetary metric given above, as it includes the associated
risk, but it will only be considered as an extension.</p>

<h3>Project Design</h3>

<p>The paragraphs in this section will outline the design decisions around the agent.</p>

<p>The following reward function candidates are available in the research literature:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="https://github.com/deependersingla/deep_trader">deep_trader</a> uses a reward function based on sales profit per action.</li>
<li><a href="https://github.com/huseinzol05/Stock-Prediction-Models">Stock prediction models</a> uses rate of return = ((total budget - initial budget) / initial budget) as a reward
function. The rate of return is calculated over all daily time slots.</li>
<li><a href="http://cslt.riit.tsinghua.edu.cn/mediawiki/images/5/5f/Dtq.pdf">Wang et al. - Deep Q-trading</a> show how to use Q-learning for trading decisions and they found that the accumulated
wealth over n days in the past was a good candidate for a reward function. So this project will adopt this approach.</li>
</ul>


<p>The reward function properties look like this:</p>

<ul>
<li>there are penalties for overdrawing the monthly available savings budget, for selling more funds than available in
the portfolio and for going into debt when buying funds.</li>
<li>the reward function will be properly scaled, either using <code>tanh()</code> or a similar function.</li>
</ul>


<p>The agent state consists of the last N values of the ETF index prices, the current portfolio (i.e. number of shares per fund)
and the current budget. The state space itself is continuous as it contains real-valued prices, budgets and funds. The
action space is continuous as the agent can decide per time slot on the number of shares to trade (or 0 if it does
not trade) for each fund. A positive amount means buying funds and a negative amount means selling funds.</p>

<p>The learning algorithm is deep deterministic policy gradients (DDPG), based on source code from the Udacity
quadcopter project). This algorithm fits nicely, as it can process a continuous state and action space and is
deterministic in nature.</p>

<p>The training process follows the example of <a href="https://github.com/huseinzol05/Stock-Prediction-Models">Stock prediction models</a> and <a href="https://github.com/teddykoker/blog.git">Teddy Koker&rsquo;s Blog entry</a>; its
parameters look as follows:</p>

<ul>
<li>The window size determines, what temporal section of the values is considered by the agent; for example, the agent might
only be trained on the last two weeks of closing values. The idea is to have a sliding window over the fund price time series.</li>
<li>The neural networks are trained with the same input data in a number of iterations, so that convergence is reached.
If the total reward after each iteration does not change significantly anymore, the training can be stopped early.</li>
</ul>


<p>The output of the agent is visualized using a chart with trading signals for an individual index / product.
Please see the following chart as an example
(source: <a href="https://github.com/huseinzol05/Stock-Prediction-Models">Stock prediction models</a>). Its x-axis are the time slots (days) and its y-axis are the closing share prices.
 The triangles indicate the trading actions.</p>

<p><img src="./example_agent_output.png" title="Exemplary Agent Output" alt="Exemplary Agent Output" /></p>

<p>The user can clearly see the value development and the trading actions in one chart (based on the learned trading policy).
The same type of chart is provided for the benchmark strategy.</p>

<h4>Workflow</h4>

<p>For the initial development of the trading agent, the following workflow is applied:</p>

<ol>
<li>manual data retrieval from the Internet</li>
<li>implement data loading, cleansing and pre-processing using Python pandas package</li>
<li>create test and training data set (e.g. in scikit-learn)</li>
<li>implement DDPG agent based on Python source code in https://github.com/udacity/RL-Quadcopter-2</li>
<li>train agent and manually tweak network hyperparameters, network architecture and reward function</li>
<li>build visualization based on <a href="https://github.com/huseinzol05/Stock-Prediction-Models">Stock prediction models</a>, i.e. charts (using matplotlib) and
tables (using pandas in a Jupyter notebook)</li>
</ol>


<p>Data cleansing and pre-processing includes the following activities:</p>

<ul>
<li>standardization and/or scaling, null-value treatments etc. of ETF index prices</li>
<li>creation of a common calendar for all three indices, on which the individual ETF index prices are joined.</li>
</ul>


<h4>Extensions</h4>

<p>A possible extension of the described proposal includes the automation of the workflow, such that the stock data is picked
up daily, and the agent writes out the trading decision regularly to a file or a database.
Another extension could be the automated retraining of the deep network models, e.g. every month. The retraining would
ensure that the agent catches up on current trends of the stock market.</p>

<p><a href="https://www.wikifolio.com/de/de/home">Wikifolio</a>, a German company, uses a social media platform to share investment
portfolios of platform members and offers the chance to investors to put their money in one of these portfolios. If a
trading agent was successful, it could be used there as well.</p>
