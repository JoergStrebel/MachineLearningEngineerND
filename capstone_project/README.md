# Deep RL Trading Agent

*Teach an agent how to trade the stock market!*

In this project, an agent learns to make buying and selling decisions using a reinforcement learning algorithm! The agent is benchmarked against a traditional buy-and-hold strategy.

## Project Instructions

1. Create and activate a new environment (in Linux).

```
conda env create -f capstone_project_deeprlagent.yaml
source activate deeprlagent
```

3. Create an [IPython kernel](http://ipython.readthedocs.io/en/stable/install/kernel_install.html) for the `deeprlagent` environment. 
```
python -m ipykernel install --user --name deeprlagent --display-name "deeprlagent"
```

4. Open the notebook.
```
cd <project directory>
jupyter notebook deeprlagent_project.ipynb
```

5. Before running code, change the kernel to match the `deeprlagent` environment by using the drop-down menu (**Kernel > Change kernel > deeprlagent**). Then, follow the instructions in the notebook.

6. The needed conda packages to complete this project are documented in the `capstone_project_deeprlagent.yaml` file in the repository.

7. Data acquisition: please see the report and the Jupyter notebook fo details.
